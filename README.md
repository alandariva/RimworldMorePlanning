## Building

### Stantard way

- Copy Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.dll from RimWorldWin_Data/Managed/ folder to Source/MorePlanning/Library/
- Copy HugsLib.dll and 0Harmony.dll to Source/MorePlanning/Library

Compile the C# project Source/MorePlanning.

If you want to generate only the release files, use the semi-automated build or take a look at Gruntfile.js

### Semi-automated (Windows)

This method uses grunt to automate the build process. To setup:

- Install HugsLib
- Install node v8+
- Clone this repository inside mod folders. The name of the folder should not be MorePlanning.
- Run `npm install`
  - This will install required libs to execute build process.
- Run `node node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt setup`
  - This will copy dlls for modding from game folder

Finally, use `node node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt build` to build the mod.

`node node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt build-dist` can be used to create a folder called MorePlanning just with files needed to be released.
